# 📘 Short and Crisp Introduction
st.write("""
White blood cells (WBCs) are crucial components of the immune system that protect the body from infections and diseases.  
They are classified into four main types:

- **Neutrophils** — the first responders that fight bacterial and fungal infections.  
- **Lymphocytes** — produce antibodies and destroy virus-infected or abnormal cells.  
- **Monocytes** — act as clean-up cells, removing dead tissue and attacking pathogens.  
- **Eosinophils** — help control allergic reactions and combat parasitic infections.  

Classification of these cells from microscopic images aids in the **early detection of infections, allergies, and blood disorders**,  
enabling faster and more reliable medical diagnosis.
